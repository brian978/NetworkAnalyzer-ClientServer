NetworkAnalyzer-ClientServer
============================

This is part of the NetworkAnalyzer project but it something written in Java because it couldn't be done as easy in PHP.

This part of the application allows the application to run certain basic commands on the remote systems that it monitors
to collect data (like network traffic).
